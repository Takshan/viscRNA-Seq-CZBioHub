# virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq
Try to sequence transcriptomes and viruses of infected cells.

This repo consists of two parts:
- `builder` contains instructions to set up an Amazon EC2 AMI with all the software required to process reads into count tables. This part is reserved for development and should ideally only be run by a CI worker in the cloud.
- `runner` contains a command-line program that instantiates one such AMI to run the processing pipeline on a specific dataset. This part is released as part of CD for users to download.
